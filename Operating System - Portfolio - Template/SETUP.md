# Portfolio Template Setup Guide

This is a Windows-themed portfolio template that you can quickly customize with your own information. All personal details are stored in a single `profile.js` file, making it easy to update.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Open `profile.js` and update your information**
   - Replace all the default values with your own details
   - See the "Customization" section below for detailed instructions

3. **Add your profile image**
   - Place your profile picture in the `images/` folder
   - Name it `profile.jpeg` (or update the path in `profile.js`)

4. **Add your resume** (optional)
   - Place your resume PDF in the `resume/` folder
   - Update the filename in `profile.js` if needed

5. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   - No build process needed - it works instantly!

## Customization Guide

All customizable information is in `profile.js`. Here's what to update:

            technologies: "Tech1, Tech2, Tech3",
            progress: 85  // Skill proficiency 0-100
        },
        // Add more skills...
    ]
}
```

### Projects
Update the `projects` array with your projects:

        description: "Short description of the project",
        url: "https://link-to-project.com",
        category: "business"  // Options: business, scripts, web
    },
    // Add more projects...
]
```

    about: "Your about text for the terminal",
    skills: "Your skills list",
    contact: "Your contact info",
    whoami: "Your title/position",

## Customization Tips

### Adding More Social Links
Add new entries to the `social` object in `profile.js`:
```javascript
twitter: {
    url: "https://twitter.com/yourhandle",
    username: "yourhandle",
    display: "twitter.com/yourhandle"
}
```

### Changing Profile Sections
Update the content templates in `index.html`'s `getContent()` function. Most use template literals with `PROFILE.` references, so they automatically pull from `profile.js`.

### Modifying Colors
Look for color codes like `#667eea` (primary purple) and `#764ba2` (secondary purple) in the CSS section of `index.html`.

### Adding New Windows
1. Add a new entry to the desktop icons HTML
2. Add to the start menu
3. Create content in the `contents` object
4. Add event handlers if needed

## Troubleshooting

**Profile data not showing?**
- Make sure `profile.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check your browser console for errors (F12)
- Refresh the page

**Profile image not loading?**
- Verify the image path in `profile.js`
- Try absolute paths: `images/profile.jpeg`
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP

**Resume won't download?**
- Make sure the PDF file is in the `resume/` folder
- Verify the exact filename matches in `profile.js`

**Terminal commands not working?**
- Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
- Verify PROFILE object is defined
- Make sure all required properties are in `profile.js`

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Profile Image**: Use a high-quality headshot (ideally square format)
2. **Resume**: Keep it to 1-2 pages for easy viewing
3. **Projects**: Include links to GitHub, live demos, or project pages
4. **Skills**: Be honest about your proficiency levels
5. **Bio**: Make it personal - stand out from other portfolios!
